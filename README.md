# Personal Website

This is my personal website/portfolio that I made over the first little bit of my winter break 2024.

The pages are lazy loaded using HTMX, and is generally just basic HTML and CSS. I used AJAX and jquery to make my own last.fm widget to display what song I'm listening to at any given moment. 

To access, just go to <a href="Woodsii.github.io">Woodsii.github.io</a>!
