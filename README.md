half personal website, half learning opportunity using "learning web design" by Jennifer Niederst Robbins

## Summary
This is **going** to be a personal website/portfolio, however I don't really believe in just grabbing a template from somewhere. With this project, I really want to teach myself the ins and outs of HTML, CSS and JS for web development. In order to learn these things, I am using the textbook "Learning Web Design" by Jennifer Niederst Robbins. 

## Progress
So far, I have a very strong grasp of HTML and it's concepts, and am currently working through the majesty of CSS.
