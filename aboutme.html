<h1> About Me </h1>

<p> Hey! My name is Bennett Woods. I am currently a junior at Stevens Institute of Technology, studying Computer Science focusing in AI, with a minor in Cybersecurity. I have a passion for learning new things, and applying my skills in novel ways.</p>

<p> I'm also a huge music nerd! I'm currently the president of the Stevens Underground Music Awareness Comittee (SUMAC), where I organize and run free shows on campus for students.
