<p>
    Currently, im working on a couple things (outside of normal school work)

    <ul> 
        <li> Working through Project Euler challenges in Rust </li>
        <li> Preparing for my senior design project, where we are going to combine EEG readings with machine learning.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p> 
    Here's some of my completed projects!

        <div class="item-blurb"> 
            My little winter break project. Wrote this using HTMX, AJAX and a little bit of jquery for the last.fm widget.

        <a href="https://github.com/btenc/assembly-visualizer">ASMVis - Assembly Interpreter</a>
        <div class="item-blurb"> 
            Final project for my web development class. We wrote an Assembly interpreter in javascript, and made a cute front end for it. I worked on the back-end: routing, middleware and the like.

    <li class="portfolio-item"> 
        <a href="/"> CP-Mv - CPU </a>
        <div class="item-blurb"> 
            Final project for my Computer Architecture class. I had to design a cpu in logism from the ground up. That includes the opcode, instructions, instruction pipeline, etc. I also wrote an assembler for the assembly language I made.
        </div>
    </li> 
    <li class="portfolio-item"> 
        <a href="/">Bankruptcy Prediction w/ML</a>
        <div class="item-blurb"> 
            Final project for my machine learning fundementals and applications class. It was a group project, where we were given a heavily imbalanced dataset on a wide range of statistics and were asked to build a model that could predict if a company would go bankrupt. 
            We utilized various feature selection and engineering techniques, such as factor analysis & visualization techniques. To actually predict bankruptcy, we used stacking models with cross validation. We were scored on number of features and the accuracy of predictions. In the end, our group came in second place with ~81% accuracy.
