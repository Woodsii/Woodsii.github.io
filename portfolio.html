        <a href="/">Bankruptcy Prediction w/ML</a>
        <div class="item-blurb"> 
            Final project for my machine learning fundementals and applications class. It was a group project, where we were given a heavily imbalanced dataset on a wide range of statistics and were asked to build a model that could predict if a company would go bankrupt. 
            We utilized various feature selection and engineering techniques, such as factor analysis & visualization techniques. To actually predict bankruptcy, we used stacking models with cross validation. We were scored on number of features and the accuracy of predictions. In the end, our group came in second place with ~81% accuracy.
